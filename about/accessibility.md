##Â Standards compliance

This website has been designed to meet the highest possibility accessibility standards, and has been tested against the [WCAG 2.0 guidelines](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).

## Browser and device support

This website has been designed to provide an appropriate experience regardless of which device is being used to access it. Although optimised for modern browsers, the content of the website is also accessible to older browsers although certain design and layout elements may appear differently depending on the capabilities of older browsers.

## Look and feel

All colours have been checked for sufficient contrast and colour blindness simulations have been run on the website to make sure that the colour scheme itself is accessible.

Text has been sized using relative units so that users can easily resize it to their own preferences. A default font size equivalent to 18px has been used throughout the site.

## Technology and coding standards

To make the site as navigable as possible to users of assistive technology such as screen readers and refreshable braille displays, all content has been marked appropriately with heading tags used in the correct order. WAI Aria landmark roles have been also been used.
