## What I do

I design and build [websites which are good to look at, easy to use](/work) and [accessible to everyone](/about/accessibility.html). I love working on a project all the way from research and planning through to testing and launch but I'm just as happy coming in and starting work on something which you've already begun to get off the ground.

There's not much point in having a lovely new website if you don't know how to use it so I'll also provide you with everything you need to keep things running smoothly after your website has been launched.

I [write about design and development](/blog) so if you're interested in getting an idea of how I like to go about things then that would be a good place to start.

## What I don't do

I don't convert existing designs into websites. Design and development go hand-in-hand and I'm not comfortable working on a website if I'm not allowed to have a say in what it looks like. If you already have a designer or design team then I'm very happy to work in collaboration with them.

I don't provide hosting services, register domain names or set up email addresses but if you need a hand with that then I can point you in the right direction.

I don't add or update content to a website after it's been launched. Every website I build has a content management system so that you can do that yourself. If you decide you'd like your website to look a bit different or do something new further down the line, then I'm always happy to revisit an old friend. 

## Background

Like a lot of web designers I arrived here by taking the long way round, learning to code in my spare time while working as a bar manager, a media researcher, in local government and as a hi-tech music specialist. I found myself at Taylor &amp; Francis just as the academic world was starting to move online, and from there I managed turn a job which involved a small bit of web design into one which involves nothing else. 

## Education

I have an MA in [Web Design and Content Planning](http://www.websitearchitecture.co.uk/_) (with a distinction) from the University of Greenwich. Before becoming a designer I studied English Literature at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, and I have a BA in English and an MA in Literary Studies.

## The geeky details

My favourite design tools are a sharp pencil and [Whitelines writing paper]([http://whitelines.se/]) and when it's time to move to the screen I do most of my design work in the browser. I use Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator for working with photographs and graphics. 

When it comes to code I use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) to write HTML5, PHP, CSS (via [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)) and JavaScript (via [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)). I use Mac OS at home and Windows and Linux at work. I love using the terminal because it makes me feel like a 1980s hacker.

My preferred content management systems are [ExpressionEngine](http://ellislab.com/expressionengine), [Perch](http://grabaperch.com/) and [Statamic](http://statamic.com/) but I always use the right tool for the job, even if it's a tool I've never used before.

At Taylor &amp; Francis we use [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) for version control, and [Jira](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview) and [Confluence](http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/overview/team-collaboration-software) for project management; at home I use [Git](http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/overview/team-collaboration-software) and [Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com/). I deploy most of my websites from [Beanstalk](http://beanstalkapp.com/) but this one is deployed and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/jeatt/jeatt.github.io).
