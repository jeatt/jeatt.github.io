## What are cookies?

Normally cookies are something delicious that you eat with coffee but in this case cookies are small data files which are created and stored in your browser as you use the web. Nearly all websites use cookies of some description and they're needed to make things like shopping carts work.

## What cookies are used on this website?

 The only cookies which are used on this website are from Google Analytics which collects anonymous user data so that I can see how my website is being used, and a nameless cookie from Fontdeck which is required to receive fonts securely. 

## Why are you telling me this?

Since May 2012 European law has required website owners to tell their users what cookies are being used on a websites and what they are being used for. The law wasn't really created for small websites like this but it applies to them regardless, and I can't expect you to trust me to work on your website if I don't know the relevant laws. If you're interested in this kind of thing then the Information Commissioner's Office has [a good write up](http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies). 


## What if I don't like cookies?

Not everyone has a sweet tooth so if you would like to disable tracking cookies, Google offer a [handy little set of browser add ons](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). The Fontdeck cookie can't be disabled but this website wouldn't work very well without it. If you're not comfortable with that then the only option is to stop using my website.
