## What are cookies?

Normally cookies are something delicious that you eat with coffee (to the horror of many I favour an oat and raisin over a chocolate chip),  but in this case cookies are small data files which are created and stored in your browser as you use the web.

Nearly all websites use cookies of some description, but the only ones which are being used on this website are from Google Analytics, a third party service which collects anonymous user data and allows me to see how people are using my website. 

## Why are you telling me this?

Since 2012, European law has required website owners to inform their users about what cookies are being used on their websites, and what they are being used for. Although the law wasn't really created for small websites like this it applies to them regardless, and I can't expect you to trust me to work on your website if I'm not aware of the laws which apply to my profession.

## What if I don't like cookies?

Not everyone has a sweet tooth, and you can use this link to [disable cookies on this website](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/advanced#optout). This will delete any Google Analytics cookies which were set by this website, and create a single cookie with a very long life time which will prevent Google Analytics cookies from being restored.
