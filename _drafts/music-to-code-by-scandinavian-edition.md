title: "Music to Code by: Scandinavia"
summary: "A lot of my favourite music is Scandinavian and one of my biggest regrets in life is not going to see A-Ha's farewell tour in 2011. This is a playlist of Scandinavian music I like to listen to when I'm working."

The playlist is available on [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/user/tomjeatt/playlist/4JGdNBBsONWIUFFS1rev22) and [Rdio](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTMkrAs/).

## *Det Er Mig Der Holder* Træerne Sammen by Under Byen

For the first 20 seconds you feel like this is a song which should have been left in 2002 with the rest of the Portishead clones. Then the voice comes in. Then the horns come in. Then all is forgiven. [Listen on Spotify](http://google.com) | [Listen on Rdio](http://google.com)

## *10 Rokkstig* by Jóhann Jóhannsson

## *Public Image* by Alphabeat

Alphabeat's first album is one of the finest pop albums ever made. Their decision to cover a PiL song was the icing on the cake. [Listen on Spotify](http://google.com) | [Listen on Rdio](http://google.com)

## *Cervux Sequential* by Apparatjik

Apparatjik are a kind of low-key supergroup, made up of a member each of Mew (Jonas), A-Ha (Magne) and, um, Coldplay (Guy). That's two thirds Scandinavian so close enough. I couldn't find a place on this playlist for Mew which broke my heart, but they're too song-led, so this is a consolation prize I'm awarding to myself. *Cervux Sequential* is a pretty straightforward dance track up until 3:02 when something magical happens.

## *Triangle Walks* by Fever Ray

I love *The Knife* but they're hectic, and a bit unsettling. Fever Ray are also unsettling, but much less hectic. I can stick this album on repeat and all of a sudden realise I've spent ten hours coding and listened to it twelve and a half times.

## *The Jerker* Stafraenn Hakon

This is an incredibly sunny song for a man from Iceland. It makes me feel like I'm watching the sun set over the sea at the end of hot summer's day, and just as I'm thinking about putting a jumper on, the last ray of sunlight settles on my arm and I decide the jumper can wait.

## *Dreams Today* by Efterklang

This was the hardest one to pick. The album this is from, *Piramida*, is one of my all time favourites. *The Ghost* isn't my favourite song from the album but it is the most appropriate for this playlist. *Sedna* (or *Monument* or *Dreams today*) has the effect of bringing me out of what I'm doing; *The Ghost*, with its shuffling backbeat and hypnotic horn section, has a drone-like quality which maintains rather than breaks my concentration.

## *End Theme* by Jóhann Jóhannsson

This is a wonderful piece of music to listen to while leaning back in your chair and drinking a hot cup of coffee, letting your subconscious nibble away at the edges of that tricky problem that you can't quite solve. [Listen on Spotify](http://google.com) | [Listen on Rdio](http://google.com)

## *Am I Wry, No?* by Mew

Ok I lied, and actually I cheated as well. This isn't a good song to code to at all. But it's a brilliant song to help you get your head out of the code and back into the real world. Case in point: I just gave this playlist a run through while I was working, and coding became air guitar which became air drums which became air guitar which became air drums which became air strings and so on and so forth until the end of the song when it became air piano. I've done enough work for today anyway. [Listen on Spotify](http://google.com) | [Listen on Rdio](http://google.com)

## Bonus Estonian

### *Cantus in memoriam Benjamin Britten* by Arvo Part

Originally this playlist contained a piece of music by the well known Finnish composer Arvo Part who on closer inspection turned out to be Estonian. If you don't mind an Estonian interloper, this composition slots in just after *End Theme*.
