title: "Music to code by: Scandinavia"
standfirst: "A lot of my favourite music is Scandinavian, although I'm not sure why. Maybe the climate produces musicians who make the kind of music I like to listen to. This is a playlist of Scandinavian music I like to listen to when I'm working."

- I put together a lot of coding playlists, so this is is likely to be the first post of many.

## *10 Rokkstig* by Jóhann Jóhannsson

A song which sounds like Van Halen's *Why Can't this be Love?* played on a cheap guitar plugged into a 10w practice amp accompanied by a Yamaha home keyboard retrieved from a skip. Absolutely brilliant.

## *Public Image* by Alphabeat

PiL's first album is one of the finest post-punk/new wave albums ever made. Alphabeat's first album is one of the finest pop albums ever made. Even so, there's no reason why the latter covering the former should work, especially when it involves whistling. Then again there's no reason why it shouldn't. And it does.

## *Cervux Sequential* by Apparatjik

Apparatjik are a kind of low-key supergroup, made up of a member each of Mew, A-Ha and, um, Coldplay. That's two thirds Scandinavian and two thirds two of my favourite bands (the same two thirds in both cases) so close enough. *Cervux Sequential* is a pretty straightforward dance track up until 3:02 when something magical happens.

## *Konami (Dreamtrak Diamond Sound)* by Apparat Organ Quartet

AOQ (formed by by Jóhann Jóhannsson who's cropping up all over this playlist) are more of a musical collective than a band. Mostly they're tooth-rattling although every now and then they're head soothing; this remix is kind of in-between. For the first few seconds it sounds alarmlingly like the start of Whitney Houston's *I want to Dance with Somebody*, before morphing into something which sounds a bit like an 80s version of Daft Punk mixed up with a little bit of the (theme from *The Clothes Show*)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAAelPf62Xs]. I don't know why, but when I'm listening to this song I get twice as much work done.

## *Dry and Dusty* by Fever Ray

I like The Knife but they're hectic and a bit unsettling, and far too jittery to listen to when you're trying to concentrate. Fever Ray, the solo project of The Knife's Karin Dreijer, are also unsettling but more hypnotic than hectic. I can put their album on repeat and all of a sudden realise I've spent ten hours coding and listened to it twelve and a half times. This is one of the best songs on the album.

## *The Living Layer* by Efterklang

This is simply a beautiful song from a beautiful album, *Piramida*. I tried nearly every song from the album on this playlist, but this is the one that stuck.

## *The Jerker* Stafraenn Hakon

This is an incredibly sunny song for a man from Iceland. It makes me feel like I'm watching the sun set over the sea at the end of hot summer's day, and just as I'm thinking about putting a jumper on, the last ray of sunlight settles on my arm and I decide the jumper can wait.

## *End Theme* by Jóhann Jóhannsson

This is a wonderful piece of music to listen to while leaning back in your chair and drinking a hot cup of coffee, letting your subconscious nibble away at the edges of that tricky problem that you can't quite solve. It was written by the same Jóhann Jóhannsson who wrote the first track on this playlist, although you'd be hard pressed to tell.

## *While the Cold Winter Waiting* by Trentemøller

For years I thought that Trentemøller was on a par with club DJs like Armin van Buuren and Paul van Dyk. Great at what they do, but really not my cup of tea. I think it's because he does a lot of remixing and I was used to seeing his name in brackets. Then one day I listened to him and it turns out he's really really good. This song is interesting, and lilting, and glitchy, and completely wonderful. There's even a bit where it threatens to break into Eric Clapton's guitar part from Phil Collins' *Another Day in Paradise*. Don't let that put you off. He makes that sound wonderful as well.
