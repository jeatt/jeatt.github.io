title: "Music to code by: Scandinavia"
standfirst: "A lot of my favourite music is Scandinavian and one of my biggest regrets in life is not going to see A-Ha's farewell tour in 2011. This is a playlist of Scandinavian music I like to listen to when I'm working. Sadly there's no place for A-Ha."

## *10 Rokkstig* by J贸hann J贸hannsson

## *Public Image* by Alphabeat

Alphabeat's first album is one of the finest pop albums ever made. Their decision to cover a PiL song was the icing on the cake. [Listen on Spotify](http://google.com) | [Listen on Rdio](http://google.com)

## *Cervux Sequential* by Apparatjik

Apparatjik are a kind of low-key supergroup, made up of a member each of Mew (Jonas), A-Ha (Magne) and, um, Coldplay (Guy). That's two thirds Scandinavian so close enough. I couldn't find a place on this playlist for Mew which broke my heart, but they're too song-led, so this is a consolation prize I'm awarding to myself. *Cervux Sequential* is a pretty straightforward dance track up until 3:02 when something magical happens.

## *Triangle Walks* by Fever Ray

I love *The Knife* but they're hectic, and a bit unsettling. Fever Ray are also unsettling, but much less hectic. I can stick this album on repeat and all of a sudden realise I've spent ten hours coding and listened to it twelve and a half times.

## *The Jerker* Stafraenn Hakon

This is an incredibly sunny song for a man from Iceland. It makes me feel like I'm watching the sun set over the sea at the end of hot summer's day, and just as I'm thinking about putting a jumper on, the last ray of sunlight settles on my arm and I decide the jumper can wait.

## *Dreams Today* by Efterklang

This was the hardest one to pick. The album this is from, *Piramida*, is one of my all time favourites. *The Ghost* isn't my favourite song from the album but it is the most appropriate for this playlist. *Sedna* (or *Monument* or *Dreams today*) has the effect of bringing me out of what I'm doing; *The Ghost*, with its shuffling backbeat and hypnotic horn section, has a drone-like quality which maintains rather than breaks my concentration.

## *End Theme* by J贸hann J贸hannsson

This is a wonderful piece of music to listen to while leaning back in your chair and drinking a hot cup of coffee, letting your subconscious nibble away at the edges of that tricky problem that you can't quite solve. [Listen on Spotify](http://google.com) | [Listen on Rdio](http://google.com)
