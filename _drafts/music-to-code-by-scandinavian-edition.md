title: "Music to Code by: Scandinavian Edition"
standfirst: "For reasons that I don't fully understand a disproportionate amount of my favourite music is Scandinavian. My favourite band, the surprisingly underrated Mew, are Danish, and one of my biggest regrets in life is not going to see A-Ha's farewell tour in 2011. Anyway, this is my Scandinavian playlist for coding."

The playlist is available on [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/user/tomjeatt/playlist/4JGdNBBsONWIUFFS1rev22) and [Rdio](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTMkrAs/).

## *Det Er Mig Der Holder* Træerne Sammen by Under Byen

Under Byen sound a bit like Portishead. 

## *Cervux Sequential* by Apparatjik

Apparatjik are a kind of low-key supergroup, made up of a member each of Mew (Jonas), A-Ha (Magne) and, um, Coldplay (Guy). That's two thirds Scandinavian so close enough. I couldn't find a place on this playlist for Mew which broke my heart, but they're too song-led, so this is a consolation prize I'm awarding to myself. *Cervux Sequential* is a pretty straightforward dance track up until 3:02 when something magical happens. Anyway it's a song which really gets your fingers flying over the keyboard.

## *The Jerker* Stafraenn Hakon

This is an incredibly sunny song for a man from Iceland. It makes me feel like I'm watching the sun set over the sea at the end of hot summer's day, and just as I'm thinking about putting a jumper on, a last ray of warm sunlight settles on my arm. 

## *The Ghost* by Efterklang

This was the hardest one to pick. The album this is from, *Piramida*, is one of my all time favourites. *The Ghost* isn't my favourite song from the album--that would be *Sedna*--but it is the most appropriate for this playlist. *Sedna* (or *Monument* or *Dreams today*) has the effect of bringing me out of what I'm doing; *The Ghost*, with its shuffling backbeat and hypnotic horn section, has a drone-like quality which maintains rather than breaks my concentration.

## *End Theme* by Jóhann Jóhannsson

This is a wonderful piece of music to listen to while leaning back in your chair and drinking a hot cup of coffee, letting your subconscious nibble away at the edges of that tricky problem that you can't quite solve.   

## Bonus Estonian

### *Cantus in memoriam Benjamin Britten* by Arvo Part

Originally this playlist contained a piece of music by the well known Finnish composer Arvo Part who on closer inspection turned out to be Estonian. If you don't mind an Estonian interloper, this composition slots in just before *End Theme*.
