title: "&hellip; with one hand tied behind your back"

Most creative people do their best work when they have restrictions placed upon them; a completely blank piece of paper can be exciting and disheartening in equal measure. The temptation When you can do anything, it's very easy to find yourself doing nothing. It's much easier to rise to a challenge when someone tells you 'you must not.'

Real creativity is producing good work when you have someone staying your hand. We all have our shortcuts, our shorthand, our tricks. True creativity is being forced to push the old standbys to one side and produce good work with one hand tied behind your back. If there's nobody telling you what to do, well then you'll have when to tie your own hand behind your back.

For everything that I do I like to write down a set of non-negotiable constraints, whether or not someone's looking over my shoulder. It's possible that one of two of them may become less non-negotiable along the way, but by that stage they've had the desired effect. In the right circumstances a defiant flash of red across a greyscale landscape can be both an elegant final flourish and an eloquent 'I told you so.'
