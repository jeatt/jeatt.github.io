lede: "Drums are the engine note of rock music. There's no easier way to accelerate the pace of a song than to build a crescendo of kick drum, floor tom and snare. But what happens if the drums are taken away? The answer is that the artist or band have to find a different way to put their foot down, and sometimes the result is a better song."

Take *Big Love* by Fleetwood Mac. The [album version](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvSJe37U/) is ok if you like mid- to late-80s production values (which I do) but the song itself gets lost amongst the reverse cymbals and gated snares, and the slightly dark lyrics suffer from the sparkling clean digital production. The better version&#8212;the one which made it onto *The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac*&#8212;is the [live version](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTdeys4B/). No bass, no drums, no production. Just one man and his surprisingly small guitar.

Another example: *Here Comes the Flood* by Peter Gabriel, about which a friend once said 'I like what he's done with it *since*.' What he meant was that in the decades since it was first released as the [closing track to his first album](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTeLowY/), Gabriel had continued to work on the song by gradually [removing every instrument other than piano and voice](http://youtu.be/Ww9JS8dJ9fY).

Most creative people do their best work when they have restrictions placed upon them; a completely blank piece of paper can be exciting and disheartening in equal measure. When you can do anything, it's very easy to find yourself doing nothing. It's much easier to rise to a challenge when someone tells you 'you must not.'

Real creativity is producing good work when you have someone staying your hand. We all have our shortcuts, our shorthand, our tricks. True creativity is being forced to push the old standbys to one side and produce good work with one hand tied behind your back. If there's nobody telling you what to do, well then you'll have when to tie your own hand behind your back.

For everything that I do I like to write down a set of non-negotiable constraints, whether or not someone's looking over my shoulder. It's possible that one of two of them may become less non-negotiable along the way, but by that stage they've had the desired effect. In the right circumstances a defiant flash of red across a greyscale landscape can be both an elegant final flourish and an eloquent 'I told you so.'
When I sat down to write this blog post I gave myself one thing to do and one thing not to do. Can you tell what they were?
