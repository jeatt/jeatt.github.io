Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. The unexpected is our normal routine. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Well, that's certainly good to know. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data?

## Research

Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. I'll be sure to note that in my log. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately?

## Form design

Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. They were just sucked into space. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Talk about going nowhere fast.
