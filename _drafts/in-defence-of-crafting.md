- There have been two recent articles, by <a href="http://markboulton.co.uk/journal/notacraftsman">Mark Boulton</a> and <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2013/11/the-problems-with-crafting-code/">Harry Roberts</a>,on the use of the word &lsquo;craft&rsquo; by web designers. Neither of them like it, and I'd like to make the case for the defence.

I've seen lots of uses of 'craft' and 'crafted' which make me cringe, particularly if it's a sentence which also includes the words 'hand' and 'pixels.' You can't hand craft a pixel any more than you can hand craft a piece of wood. 

Harry wrote that &ldquo;I donâ€™t want my plumber to &lsquo;lovingly hand-craft his U-bends&rsquo;&rdquo;, which is fine, but I think it's the wrong comparison. Unlike websites, plumbing is not made to be seen. Most people don't invite their colleagues, friends, clients or rivals into their office toilet, offer them a cup of coffee and then ask them to admire their U-bends. That *is* something they'll do with their website though, although hopefully not while in the toilet.

I think that a better comparison is with a carpenter, because the work that we do is designed to be seen. If I asked a carpenter to build me a bookshelf, the first thing I would expect it to do is not fall over. The second thing I would expect it to do is look good. Not necessarily ornate--or whittled, to use Mark Boulton's word--, but *good*. Neat, accurate joints. Well put together.

We also need to consider who's benefit this is for. It's not other web designers we're trying to appeal to, it's clients. 'Craft' 

Works well. Looks good. The 

One of the accusations levelled at using the word 'craft' is that it's pretentious. 

What does William Blake have to do with this?

One of Harry Robert's accusations was that using the word 'craft' is pretentious.


[William Blake](http://wikipedia.com/william_blake) is best known as a poet, but by profession he engraved printing plates.

> Craft is love. And love takes time.

Craft is not necessarily love. It's pride, but pride in being able to do something 

Oddly enough, I actually agree with both of them. But I don't think it's the word craft that's at issue; it's how it's being used. I cringe at 'hand crafted code' just as much as I cringed at 'artisan bread.' But--and here's where Blake comes in--a true artisan is no different to an engineer.

Front end design *is* a craft, and it is possible to craft with code. Back end design *engineering.*

"Our job is more serious than craft, which implies hobby, or pastime."

Why does craft imply hobby or pastime? It doesn't to me. Craft implies someone who's learned a trade, and can do it accurately and efficiently. A craft can be a hobby, of course (so can web design in fact) but just because you may.

I'm going to suggest a compromise. If you let me craft the front-end, I promise to engineer the back-end.
