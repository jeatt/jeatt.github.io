standfirst:
- There have been two recent(ish) articles, by <a href="http://markboulton.co.uk/journal/notacraftsman">Mark Boulton</a> and <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2013/11/the-problems-with-crafting-code/">Harry Roberts</a>,on the use of the word &lsquo;craft&rsquo; by web designers. Neither of them like it, and I'd like to make the case for the defence.
endnotes:
- "The image on this page is a detail from William Blake's <em>The Night of Enitharmon's Joy</em> (sourced from <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:William_Blake_006.jpg'>Wikimedia Commons</a>)."
