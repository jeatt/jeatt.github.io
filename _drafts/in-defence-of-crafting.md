summary:
- Over the last few months there have been two articles, written by <a href="http://markboulton.co.uk/journal/notacraftsman">Mark Boulton</a> and <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2013/11/the-problems-with-crafting-code/">Harry Roberts</a>, on the use&#8212;or misuse&#8212;of the word &lsquo;craft&rsquo; by web designers. Neither of them like it but I'm quite fond of it myself.

[William Blake](http://wikipedia.com/william_blake) is best known as a poet, but by profession he engraved printing plates. 
 
When I was studying web design, one of my lecturers gave us a potted history of the MA. 

Harry Roberts offered the term 'engineer' as opposed to craftsman. But there's an assumption there that the two words are mutually exclusive. Colin Chapman the founder and engineering genius of Lotus Cars, was both an engineer and a craftsman. 

The assumption seems to be that crafting is a slow, laborious process. Well, yes it can be--if you're learning something new--but a skilled craftsman works quickly and accurately.

I also think the word craft communicates something important about what we do. As with any industry, there is a mass-production side to web design. It's not hard to find people offering to convert PSD files to websites.

I consider myself a designer, an engineer, and an artisan. I also consider myself a craftsman.

Funnily enough, both Mark Boulton and Harry Roberts take issue with the image of a man working in a shed. I work in a shed.
