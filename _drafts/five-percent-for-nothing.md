- "There's a story, probably apocryphal, about a drummer in a prog band who listened to his bandmates rehearsing a new song and told them it didn't need drums and put down his sticks. They decided that knowing when not to play was just as important as knowing when to play, and so gave him a credit (and royalties) anyway."

- "This is the second of three music themed posts about design. This one is about restraint. The <a href='/blog/dialling-it-back-a-notch/'>first was about taking things away</a>, and the third will be about constraint."
- "I thought this story was about Bill Bruford and Yes, and that the song was <em>Five Percent for Nothing</em>. Hence the title. But, as I can't find a source for it and the song was written by, and features, Bill Bruford, I'm wrong on all counts. I kept the title though, because it fits."

I like this story, because it says something important about the creative process. Everyone in the rehearsal room that day assumed that the song would have a drum beat, and it would have been the easiest thing in the world for the drummer to play along. It probably would have sounded ok too, and nobody would have been any the wiser.

But he took a risk. It was a financial risk, because if he didn't play then he wouldn't get paid, and an artistic risk because he played a genre of music in which drums play a starring role. It takes a lot of confidence to admit that, in this particular instance, you're not necessary.
