One thing that’s become clear to me throughout the course of this year is that I’m stuck in my ways. After the initial sketches, all my visual designs start in the same way: a 12 column grid, 960px wide. If I’m feeling particularly daring I’ll stir things up with a 16 column layout (you devil you).

A few days ago I decided that it was time to make a change. I took the momentous decision to follow the [One True Path to Wisdom](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/) (a.k.a. [responsive web design](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/). I was going to claw my way out of the stone age and into a shiny new era of iFriendly designs. I would throw off the shackles that had held me back for so long and start creating designs that *flexed*. Hurrah! I even started to write a blog post about it.

It was while writing that blog post, and explaining the reasoning behind my decision, that I noticed I was an idiot. What I was about to do was spend a huge amount of time and effort dragging myself out of a rut only to hop straight into the next rut along. In the process I was going to wilfully discard years of hard-won experience. It was like buying a ratchet set then getting home and throwing away all of the spanners.

Responsive web design is a fantastic idea but it’s nothing if it isn’t being implemented by a Responsive Web Designer. A web designer who understands and responds to the individual requirements of each project. What I should have been challenging myself to do was to learn to create responsive designs as an alternative to fixed width designs, not as a replacement. Fixed width designs are the right solution for some projects and just because I’m bored of implementing them it doesn’t mean that they’re suddenly obsolete. Similarly, media queries are a fantastic tool but learning to use them doesn’t require that I discard the entire concept of mobile stylesheets.

What I needed wasn’t a flexible layout, but a flexible mind. The rut I was in had nothing to do with the limitations of fixed width designs and everything to do with my futile search for the perfect, one-size-fits-all approach to web design.

So am I still going to learn responsive design? Absolutely, but as an alternative to fixed width designs, not a replacement. A shiny new ratchet set to complement my trusty well-worn spanners. At the same time I also have to learn to recognise the correct approach to take for each project, and then apply it. It might be a fixed width design, it might be a responsive design or it might be [something in between](http://csswizardry.com/2011/01/forget-responsive-web-design/). It might be something completely different.

I’ve learnt a lot this year, but if I had to pick one lesson as the most important it would be this one. Web design is analogue, not digital and nobody is forcing me to pick an approach and stick with it to the bitter end. Sometimes the correct approach lies somewhere in the middle and learning to recognise these shades of grey will make me a much better web designer in the future.

## Postscript

A long time ago (well, last October but doesn’t it seem an age since David was handing out badges and timetables?) I wrote the following on the forum in response to Casey’s thread, [Liquid layout – challenges the brain cells](http://www.websitearchitecture.co.uk/forum/showthread.php?3744-Liquid-layout-challenges-the-brain-cells):

> I have to say I hate liquid layouts, and I would need a lot of persuading to even try one. I can’t really think of a situation where a well designed fixed width layout and some carefully targeted style sheets wouldn’t present a preferable solution. That said I’m probably inviting someone to shoot me down by making such a broad statement!

Well, here I am seven months down the line, shooting myself down. Liquid layouts are absolutely fundamental to responsive design, and if I want to understand it I have to learn to implement them.
I’m not necessarily saying that I was wrong back then but the web design world moves quickly. I absolutely believed what I was writing at the time, and yet here I am advocating responsive design: a concept which is fundamentally reliant on the idea of a fluid, scalable, liquid layout.

What I’ve learned from this little trip down memory lane is that dogma is dogma, and substituting one dogma (fixed width) for another (responsive) doesn’t make it any better. Learn new skills, yes, but don’t forget that the old ones still have value. Keep an open mind and embrace new ideas but recognise the value and wisdom of existing ones.
