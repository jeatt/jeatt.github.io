The brief for this project was very simple: we were asked to write an essay about grids in web design using case studies to support our arguments. The details were left entirely up to us.

I wrote about the history and fundamentals of grid systems, followed by an overview of the state of the art using newspaper websites as my case studies.

Although this essay wasn't written very long ago, it's striking how much has changed. [Gridset](http://gridsetapp.com) was announced shortly after I finished writing it (although before I submitted it, hence a hastily added note) and finally gave web designers a way to use flexible, responsive grid systems on the web.
