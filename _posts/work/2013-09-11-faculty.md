Because this was a thesis project, the website itself was only one part of the project. It also involved designing and mocking up the CMS, and writing up a comprehensive research report.

## Faculty website

As part of this project I put together a comprehensive set of [identity guidelines](http://fclty.thomasjeatt.com/about/identity-guidelines.php), explaining the reasoning behind my design decisions.

## Faculty CMS

The focus of the project was the design of the content management system, rather than the design of the website so I created a [mock up of the CMS user interface](http://journalofprocrastination.thomasjeatt.com/faculty/core/dashboard/). I also mapped out the database structure that would be required to drive the CMS.

## A living document

I was very proud of my work on this project, but since finishing university I haven't had the time to devote to it that I would like and I've recently decided to stop development in its current form. That said, I'm unwilling to let go of the idea completely so I've started working on the concept from a different angle, starting with the idea of a &lsquo;living document&rsquo;&#8212;a way of presenting scientific articles and data in a more appropriate way for the web&#8212;and working outwards from there. This project will be [available on Github](http://github.com/jeatt/faculty).

The [Faculty Website](http://fclty.thomasjeatt.com) and [dashboard mockup](http://journalofprocrastination.thomasjeatt.com/faculty/core/dashboard/) are still available, as is [The Journal of Procrastination](http://journalofprocrastination.thomasjeatt.com/), a site which was built to demonstrate the CMS.
