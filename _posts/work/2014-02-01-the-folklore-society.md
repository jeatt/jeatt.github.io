The Folklore Society website was one of the first responsibilities I was handed when I started working for Taylor &amp; Francis in 2008. It was a static website, with no CMS and a structure which was more organic than planned, but strangely enough it seemed to work. Because of that, the long overdue redesign was put off until 2013.

## A surprisingly pleasant content audit

Unusually for such a big website, the content audit didn't throw up too many surprises. Caroline, the Folklore Society's dedicated content editor (who was well established in her post by the time I started), has always kept a firm grip on what goes on to the website, and just as importantly what comes down. Because of that, the majority of the information that was on the website was still relevant.

## Content reorganisation

Because everything that was on the website was still relevant, the content meetings became an exercise in reorganisation. We sat down together at a big table with a couple of pencils and a stack of post-it notes, and moved everything around until it made a lot more sense. What became clear was that a lot of the content had been added to the website in the wrong place, undoubtedly because the structure of the website had remained largely unchanged since it was built.

Having so much content available at such an early stage helped us design a robust structure which fitted the content we already had, and allowed a lot of room for as-yet unknown content to be added in the future.

## Folklore Miscellany

One of the things we noticed as we sifted through the content was that there were a number of very well researched and written articles dotted around the site. We decided to group these together under the heading of *Folklore Miscellany.*

## Lightening the load

By far the most time consuming aspect of the previous website was adding and removing non-Folklore society events. Rather than carry on doing this, I used ExpressionEngine's front end form functionality to allow users to submit events for moderation. This meant that all we needed to do now was approve the events, and they would be fed through to the website's home page.

## Next steps

As I write, the new website has been up for six months, and we're about to start on the next update which is due to be launched in early June.
