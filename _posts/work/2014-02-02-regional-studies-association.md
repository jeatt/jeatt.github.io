Because Taylor &amp; Francis and the Regional Studies Association (RSA) have worked together for so long, this was the third version of their website that we had built and hosted. The previous two websites, both of which were built before I joined the company, had been static and managed by the Taylor &amp; Francis web team. The RSA wanted direct control over their website which meant that the new website had to be built on a suitable content management system, and the RSA's staff would need to be trained how to use it. 

## Content audit

Over the years, a huge archive of material relating to the RSA and their conferences had built up on the web server. Although a lot of it was no longer available on the website itself, most of the material itself was still required as it formed part of the RSA's history. To make sure that this archive was handled appropriately, a cornerstone of this project was an in-depth content audit so that everyone involved was aware of what was held on the server. Once this had been completed, we sorted through all the documents deciding what needed to be added to the new website, what needed to be archived, and what could be deleted.

## Branding

The new website had to be in line with the RSA's current branding guidelines. As their colour scheme was dominated by very strong shades of red and blue, we used these sparingly and offset them by placing them against a simple white background.

## Content migration and content management

Because the RSA wanted to retain most of the content from their previous website, this formed a very large part of the project and it made it essential that the content management system was up to the job. I chose ExpressionEngine for this project, as it was capable of handling complicated relationships between content but could also be configured to make managing these relationships intuitive.

## Ongoing development

Since being launched in 2012, there has been one significant update to the website. I am currently working on a second major release, to make some changes to the look and feel of the website and make it easier to navigate as more and different content is added. This release is due for release in late Spring 2014.
