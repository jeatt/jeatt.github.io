I first started working with Podengo when Gemma Stokes, Podengo's founder, was just about to strike out on her own after a decade working as a qualitative researcher. She had a design for a website which had been put together by a graphic designer and she needed someone to build it for her. I was juggling work and University and I didn't really have the time, but she was an old school friend so I did it anyway.

That was in February 2012 and since then Podengo have gone from strength to strength. Watching the business grow from one person with a laptop and a head full of ideas to a thriving company with a staff of five has been a real privilege and because of that, of all the projects I've worked on this is the one which has given me the most satisfaction.

##Â Evolution

The first version of the website did its job well, but that job was to get the company off the ground. As the company became more successful their requirements changed and in April 2013 Gemma asked me to redesign the website to better reflect the way in which Podengo worked.

The first version of the website had been mostly informational, but social media and online sign-ups had become a bigger part of Podengo's day-to-day work than had originally been envisaged. The company's branding was very strong, so I took that as a starting point, but I made significant changes to the structure and design, improving the typography, layout and responsiveness of the website.

We put more emphasis on social media and recruitment for specific projects, and redesigned the sign-up form to provide a better user experience. We also improved the form validation to reduce the number of sign-ups with missing or incorrect information.

## An ongoing project

As the company continues to grow so does the website, and I'm currently working with Podengo on a second update, although this one is building on the current design rather than replacing it. The improved version of the website is due to be launched in April 2014 at which point I'll also be rewriting this project page.
