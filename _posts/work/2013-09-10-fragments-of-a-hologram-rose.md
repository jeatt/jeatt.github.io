The task we were set was really simple: typeset a piece of literature. As my favourite writer is Angela Carter I started working with one of her short stories, *The Snow Child*. It was a stark, minimal red and white design, and it fitted the story perfectly. I was pleased with it. Then, browsing through [Fontdeck](http://fontdeck.com), I stumbled upon a font called [False Idol](http://fontdeck.com/font/falseidol/regular), and I started playing around with text shadows, keyframe animation and colour, and wound up creating something that looked a lot like William Gibson and nothing at all like Angela Carter. Luckily I like William Gibson, so I dug out my copy of *Burning Chrome* and found a short story that fitted the design I'd created.

This is not a production ready website. It only works in modern browsers, I make no claims about its accessibility, and in terms of project workflow I went about the whole thing back to front. That's what made it so much fun to work on.
