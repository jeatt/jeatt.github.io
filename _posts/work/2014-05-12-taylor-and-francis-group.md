This was an interesting project because it was actually two projects running in parallel. The first was to redesign and rebuild the Taylor & Francis Group website; the second was to work with other designers across the company and an external design agency to write a set of style guidelines for future projects.

## Web style guidelines

Although the Taylor & Francis Group already had a set of branding guidelines, these had been written for print. The lack of a suitable set of guidelines for our websites meant that each individual part of the company&#8212;and within those parts each individual design team&#8212;took their own approach to design and branding. The result was that our websites lacked a common identity.

Because of this we decided to take the opportunity to use the new group website as a pilot scheme. I was sent an initial draft of the guidelines to refer to when I started work on the look and feel of the new website. When the guidelines came up short, either because the suggested style wasn't appropriate for the web, or the guidelines themselves were ambiguous, I worked with the external design team to find a solution which worked in terms of usability and accessibility, and which also fitted into their vision of the Taylor & Francis brand. Once we'd found a solution, we discussed it with senior management and the other Taylor & Francis lead designers, and if we were all happy with what had been agreed then it was incorporated into the guidelines.

The end result was a style guide which gave us a common brand identity to refer to, while at the same time allowing each designer the freedom to make decisions about layout and content based on the requirements of each individual project.

## The Taylor &amp; Francis group website

The other part of the project was the design of the group website itself. In terms of content, our aim was to consolidate information which was spread throughout a number of our other websites, and reorganise it in a way which made sense to our customers, rather than in a way which reflected how the company was organised.

The look and feel of the website was, naturally, based on the colours and typefaces which we decided on when we were working on the style guidelines. At quite an early stage of the project though we removed most references to layout from the guidelines, which meant that the layout of the website was designed could be designed around the content.

With all the content in place I was able to design from the mobile version up, making sure that the content was displayed appropriately and accessibly, regardless of which device a user was accessing it with.

## Next steps

The new website was launched in May 2014, and work has already begun on the next release which will see content brought across from some of the other Taylor &amp; Francis websites so that they can be decommissioned, making content more discoverable and consolidating our brand identity.

The style guidelines have been distributed throughout the company, and are already being used as the basis for both rebuilt and brand new websites. The intention is that both the guidelines and the new group website will help Taylor &amp; Francis develop a strong online identity.
