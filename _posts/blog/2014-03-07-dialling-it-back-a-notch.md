Take *Big Love* by Fleetwood Mac. The [album version](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvSJe37U/) is ok if you like mid- to late-80s production values but the song itself gets lost amongst the reverse cymbals and gated snares, and the dark(ish) lyrics suffer from the sparkling clean digital production. The better version&#8212;the one which made it onto *The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac*&#8212;is the [live version](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTdeys4B/). No bass, no drums, no production. Just one man and his surprisingly small guitar.

Another example: *Here Comes the Flood* by Peter Gabriel, about which a friend once said 'I like what he's done with it *since*.' What he meant was that in the decades since it was first released as the [closing track to his first album](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTeLowY/), Gabriel had continued to work on the song by gradually [removing every instrument other than piano and voice](http://youtu.be/Ww9JS8dJ9fY), revealing the sparse and beautiful song that had been hiding beneath the original arrangement.  

## Sometimes design is taking things away

Often it's the job of a designer to take things away. It's also the job of the designer to finish writing articles before posting them online.
