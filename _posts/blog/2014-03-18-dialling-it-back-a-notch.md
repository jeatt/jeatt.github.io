Take *Big Love* by Fleetwood Mac. The [album version](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvSJe37U/) is ok if you like mid- to late-80s production values but the song itself gets lost amongst the reverse cymbals and gated snares, and the dark lyrics (well, dark for Fleetwood Mac; we're not in Trent Reznor territory) suffer from the sparkling clean digital production. The better version&#8212;the one which made it onto *The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac*&#8212;is the [live version](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTdeys4B/). No bass, no drums, no production. Just one man and his surprisingly small guitar.

Another example is *Here Comes the Flood* by Peter Gabriel, about which a friend once said 'I like what he's done with it *since*.' What he meant was that in the decades since it was released as the [closing track to his first album](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTeLowY/), Gabriel had continued to work on the song by gradually [removing every instrument other than piano and voice](http://youtu.be/Ww9JS8dJ9fY), revealing the sparse, beautiful song obscured beneath the original arrangement.

So what do drums, or their absence, have to do with web design? Well, it's not really about the drums. It's about the decision to take them away and it's also about the desire to keep working on something even after it's been released.

## Design is taking things away

Being a designer is as much about taking things away as it is about adding them. It's fun to push a design too far, to layer design elements in search of an unexpected harmony. At some point though it's essential to take away everything that doesn't serve a purpose. Sometimes that means losing something that you cherish, but if it doesn't help solve the problem you're working on then it's not contributing anything to the design.

I'm not suggesting that every design should be stark and minimalist&#8212;there are plenty of problems that can be solved with [bright colours and anthropomorphic logos](http://mailchimp.com/)&#8212;but every part of a design should be there for a reason and every assumption should be challenged, even (especially) the obvious ones. Just because a song has always been played with a drummer, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wouldn't sound better without one.

### As much as necessary but as little as possible

I try my best to avoid clich&eacute;s and generalisations, but the one rule I apply to every project I work on (neatly managing both a clich&eacute; and a generalisation at the same time) is to include as much as necessary but as little as possible. Other than &lsquo;it depends&rsquo; it's probably my most overused phrase, but it provides a reliable shorthand for something important.

People visit a website because they want something, whether that's to buy a pair of trainers or to find an email address or phone number, and it's our job to give them everything they need to do that. It's also our job to make it as easy as possible. As a website user I hate being asked to make an unnecessary decision (&lsquo;for more information email bert@123.com or ernie@123.com&rsquo;). This creates a moment of uncertainty (&lsquo;who's more likely to get back to me first, Bert or Ernie?&rsquo;) and a moment of uncertainty can be all it takes to lose a customer.

## The advantages of restlessness

To bring things full circle, there are several live versions of *Here Comes the Flood.* Even after he had recorded and released it, Peter Gabriel kept thinking of ways to make it better. That sense of restlessness is important to anyone who does something creative for a living, no matter how grand their stage.

All good  designers look back at their work and see things they wish they had done differently. Unsurprisingly, given what I've written above, I often find small design elements which I wish I'd taken away. As web designers we're lucky, because we're often given the chance to make incremental changes to our work, something that's not so easy for our cousins who work in print.

Even when we don't though, it's important to look back at what we've done and consider how we would have done it differently. It's important to stay restless.
