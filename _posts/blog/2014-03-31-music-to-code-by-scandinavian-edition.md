title: "Music to code by: Scandinavian edition"
standfirst: "A lot of my favourite music is Scandinavian, although I'm not sure why. Maybe the climate produces musicians who make the kind of music I like. This is a playlist of Scandinavian music I listen to when I'm working. The playlist is on both <a href='http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTMkrAs/'>Rdio</a> and <a href='http://open.spotify.com/user/tomjeatt/playlist/4JGdNBBsONWIUFFS1rev22'>Spotify</a>."

## *10 Rokkstig* by Jóhann Jóhannsson

A song which sounds like Van Halen's *Why Can't this be Love?* played on a cheap guitar plugged into a 10w practice amp accompanied by a Yamaha home keyboard retrieved from a skip. Absolutely brilliant. <i class="fa fa-headphones"></i> [Rdio](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTeXMu4/) or [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/track/1SlCUN3VxkkydPVlusb4OS).

## *Public Image* by Alphabeat

PiL's first album is one of the finest post-punk/new wave albums ever made. Alphabeat's first album is one of the finest pop albums ever made. Even so, there's no reason why the latter covering the former should work, especially with Keith Levene's guitar parts replaced by someone whistling. Then again there's no reason why it shouldn't. And it does. <i class="fa fa-headphones"></i> [Rdio](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTddYBrQ/) or [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/track/7CZ6EjBjSNDeVGzJivX0ql).

## *Konami (Dreamtrak Diamond Sound)* by Apparat Organ Quartet

Apparat Organ Quartet (formed by by Jóhann Jóhannsson who's cropping up all over this playlist) are more of a musical collective than a band. Mostly their music is tooth-rattling although every now and then it can be head soothing; this remix is kind of in-between. For the first few seconds it sounds alarmingly like the start of Whitney Houston's *I wanna Dance with Somebody*, before morphing into something which sounds ike an 80s version of Daft Punk mixed up with a little bit of [the theme from *The Clothes Show*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAAelPf62Xs). When I'm listening to this song I get twice as much work done. <i class="fa fa-headphones"></i> [Rdio](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTew4wk/) or [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/track/0T3QgfqKgqgGIxlz1qJTM1).

## *Cervux Sequential* by Apparatjik]

Apparatjik are kind of a low-key supergroup, made up of a member each of Mew, A-Ha and, um, Coldplay. That's two thirds Scandinavian and two thirds two of my favourite bands (the same two thirds in both cases) so close enough. *Cervux Sequential* is a pretty straightforward dance track up until 3:02 when something magical happens. <i class="fa fa-headphones"></i> [Rdio](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTegX8I/) or [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/track/125ZvJ8qs1gDgY4dB455kM).

## *Dry and Dusty* by Fever Ray

I like The Knife but they're hectic and a bit unsettling, and far too jittery to listen to when you're trying to concentrate. Fever Ray, the solo project of The Knife's Karin Dreijer, are also unsettling but more hypnotic than hectic. I can put their album on repeat and all of a sudden realise I've spent ten hours coding and listened to it twelve and a half times. This is one of the best songs on the album. <i class="fa fa-headphones"></i> [Rdio](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTd7KPY/) or [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/track/7uzO18RMpWvGf2po9lyz97).

## *The Living Layer* by Efterklang

*Piramida*, the album this is taken from, is stunning. I tried every song from the album on this playlist because I love them all equally, but this is the one that stuck. <i class="fa fa-headphones"></i> [Rdio](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTdeat91/) or [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/track/4P1j6J1RTeHBal5EXjCigO).

## *Hawaii* by Mew

Mew are my favourite band, but I didn't think they belonged on this playlist. They're a bit too song-led and involving. And then this came on while I was working, and it just worked. I'm giving the credit to the steel drums. <i class="fa fa-headphones"></i> [Rdio](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTdxFao/) or [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/track/4G82qlQup3mP62BURDdl35).

## *The Jerker* Stafraenn Hakon

This is an incredibly sunny song for a man from Iceland. It makes me feel like I'm watching the sun set over the sea at the end of hot summer's day, and just as I'm thinking about putting a jumper on, the last ray of sunlight settles on my arm and I decide the jumper can wait. <i class="fa fa-headphones"></i> [Rdio](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTcaPso/) or [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/track/1q4nCC4VwaaFscASapqbVI).

## *While the Cold Winter Waiting* by Trentemøller

For years I thought that Trentemøller was on a par with club DJs like Armin van Buuren and Paul van Dyk. Great at what they do, but not really my cup of tea. I think it's because he does a lot of remixing and I was used to seeing his name in brackets. Then one day I listened to him in error and it turns out he's really really good. This song is interesting, and lilting, and glitchy, and completely wonderful. There's even a bit where it threatens to break into Eric Clapton's guitar part from Phil Collins' *Another Day in Paradise*. Don't let that put you off. He makes that sound wonderful as well. <i class="fa fa-headphones"></i> [Rdio](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTekbG4/) or [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/track/7lMfuo8XRwrrStv1WJ0viP).

## *End Theme* by Jóhann Jóhannsson

This is a perfect piece of music to listen to while leaning back in your chair and drinking a hot cup of coffee, letting your subconscious nibble away at the edges of that tricky problem that you can't quite solve. It was written by the same Jóhann Jóhannsson who wrote the first track on this playlist, although you'd be hard pressed to tell. <i class="fa fa-headphones"></i> [Rdio](http://rd.io/x/QX_ZvTcE218/) or [Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/track/6cUjRUrLOnxSQcMrPqiSIK).
